# "Public transport simulation in terms of filling them"
This project has been created for the needs of the subject named "Discrete Simulatio of Complex Systems".

## About project
**Technologies used:**
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* JQuery (JS library)
* MapBox (OpenSource framework)

**Features:**
* trams (current) positions 
* time management (time acceleration or freezing it)
* following trams path
* filtering by trams number
* current trams filling (using color scale)

**TODO:**
* detours due to accidents
* time unloading trams jam
* counting necessary, extra trams needed while delays (caused by detours)
